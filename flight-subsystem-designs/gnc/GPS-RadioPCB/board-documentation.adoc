Global Navigation and Communications Board.

Purpose and Overview: 
Provides power to Space Maniac's Celeste (GNSS Receiver) and Murgas (UHF/VHF transceiver), and interfaces their control, networking and data lines with Cubesat PC104. 
Features the Texas Instruments LMK class Clock signal Fanout buffer chip, to produce 3 separate copies of PPS (Pulse Per Second) signal, from GNSS receiver, whch is critical for timing.

Related Pulse-A Desgign Requirements: 

- Communications
1. Communication subsystem shall receive data uplinked from the RFGS
Need be tested*
2. The communications subsystem shall receive commands uplinked from RFGS
Need be tested*
3. The communications subsystem shall transmit downlink data to RFGS
Need be tested*
4. Communications subsystem shall transmit the satellite's GPS data to the RFGS/
Need be tested*

- Navigation
1. Satellite shall provide Data to the optical payload for downlink.
Need be tested
2. Satellite shall be able to determine its location through GPS
Compliant
3. The Satellite shall be capable of activating all essential systems at deployment.
Compliant


Software Accompaniments:
1. In order to activate the timing system automatically upon deployment, the gps and timing daemons, gpsd and chrony are installed to the Beaglebone via linux.
2. To access timing and location information, the Daemons are configured to access these data and update system time accordingly. 
3. Daemons are softwares that automcatically start upon system activation.

Components 

Fanout chip https://www.ti.com/product/LMK1C1104
Provides Low Jitter PPS signal fanout to ADCS, Payload controller and OBC via PC104. To Achieve high time accuracy across the sub-systems.

Molex SlimStack
This is the connector used by both Space Maniac boards. Traces will be made to link its pins to that of PC104.


Outputs of Radio:
I2C, CAN.
EXT_RST, which resets GNSS Receiver.

Outputs of GNSS Receiver.:
PPS : 1 second time synchronisation signal.
I2C, CAN : sends timestamps in accordance to each PPS pulse.
